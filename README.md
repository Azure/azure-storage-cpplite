# Azure Storage C++ Client Library (Lite)

## About

The Azure Storage Client Library (Lite) for C++ allows you to build applications against Microsoft Azure Storage's blob service. This is a minimum dependency version that provide basic object storage. For an overview of Azure Storage, see [Introduction to Microsoft Azure Storage](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-introduction/).
If you want to use other services of Azure Storage, or a more comprehensive functionality of Blob service, please see [Azure Storage C++ Client Library](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-cpp).

## Features
The full supported Azure Storage API can be found in the following list, please be aware that only part of the functionality of some APIs are supported:

## Installation

### Clone the latest code from this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-cpplite.git
```
### Install the dependencies, e.g. on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev cmake g++
```
Or, on Red Hat OS:
```
sudo yum install openssl-devel.x86_64 libcurl-devel.x86_64 cmake.x86_64 gcc-c++.x86_64
```
Please be aware that RHEL6 comes with gcc version 4.4.7, which does not meet the requirement of this SDK. In order to use this SDK, [devtoolset](http://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/devtoolset/#install) needs to be installed properly.
### Build and install azure-storage-cpplite:
```
cd azure-storage-cpplite
mkdir build.release
cd build.release
CXX=g++ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_OPENSSL=true
sudo make install
```
### Use GNUTLS instead of OpenSSL:
Alternatively, you can use GNUTLS instead of OpenSSL. Simply install GNUTLS and remove the argument `-DUSE_OPENSSL` during build.

## Usage
Simply include the header files after installing the library, everything is good to go. For a more comprehensive sample, please see [sample](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-cpplite/blob/master/sample/sample.cpp).
To build the sample, add `-DBUILD_SAMPLES=true` when building the repository.
```
#include "storage_credential.h"
#include "storage_account.h"
#include "blob/blob_client.h"

// Your settings
std::string account_name = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME";
std::string account_key = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY";
bool use_https = true;
std::string blob_endpoint = "CUSTOMIZED_BLOB_ENDPOINT";
int connection_count = 2;

// Setup the client
azure::storage_lite::shared_key_credential credential(account_name, account_key);
azure::storage_lite::storage_account(account_name, credential, use_https, blob_endpoint);
azure::storage_lite::blob_client client(storage_account, connection_count);

// Start using
auto outcome = client.create_container("YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME").get();
```

When contributing to this client library, there are following ground rules:
1. All source code change should be clearly addressing issues or adding new features, and should be covered with test.
2. Coding style should match with the existing code.
3. Any contribution should not degrade performance or complex functionality.
4. Introducing new dependency should be done with much great caution. Any new dependency should introduce significant performance improvement or unblock critical user scenario.

### Build Test
Download [Catch2 single header version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catchorg/Catch2/master/single_include/catch2/catch.hpp) and put it in the folder `.\test\catch2\`.
Add `-DBUILD_TESTS=true` when building the repository.
Please modify the [connection string here](https://github.com/katmsft/azure-storage-cpplite/blob/master/test/test_base.h#L18) to successfully run the tests. All the test uses standard Azure Storage account.
#### *Please note that in order to run test, a minimum version of g++ 5.1 is required.*
